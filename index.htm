    <h1>Welcome to GD Web!</h1>
    <p>Note: I am not a scammer, and I will never give myself credit for scratch games other people created, this serves as a type of "level browser" for easy finding. Check out iPhone (main creator) on Scratch! <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/iPhone_ATT_TWC115/">iPhone's scratch profile<br>Please do not leave hateful comments or accuse these creators of any type of theft, as this is a HOBBY for them, do not complain about the physics either, this is something very hard to code.</a></p>
