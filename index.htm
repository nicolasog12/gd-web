    <h1>Welcome to GD Web!</h1>
    <p>Note: I am not a scammer, and I will never give myself credit for scratch games other people created, this is a free non-ad website so that people can play Geometry Dash on the web easily. Check out iPhone (main creator) on Scratch! <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/iPhone_ATT_TWC115/">iPhone's scratch profile</a>/a></p>
